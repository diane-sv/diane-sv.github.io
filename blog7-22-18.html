Once upon a time, I was a neuroscience undergraduate by day, hobby programmer by night. While I was studying the neural mechanisms of the brain, I also joined computational research labs. I learned to use different programming languages like R for statistics and Matlab for signal and image processing. There was not many electives for combining programming with neuroscience and I was hungry to combine the two. That's when I joined the Neurosurgery Department at UCLA Health.
<br>
<br>
All I've done for the past two years would not have been possible without amazing mentors. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.bilwaj.com/">Dr. Bilwaj Gaonkar, PhD</a>, was my first lead post-doctoral research mentor who challenged me to use Python for image processing and machine learning as well as bash scripting.
<br>
<a href="http://mlab.neurosurgery.ucla.edu/">Dr. Luke Macyszyn, MA, MD</a>, was the think tank behind all my spine-related projects and the first to suggest using VR to me.
<br>
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ArEzS04AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Zahra Aghajan, PhD</a>, was the first to mentor me in EEG signal processing, and also the first to task me with combining Optitrack Camera technology with Unity VR.
<br>
<a href="http://lonn.semel.ucla.edu/">Dr. Nanthia Suthana, PhD</a>, was the Principal Investigator for all my memory-related projects and inspires me to take on new challenges.
<br>
<br>

One of the most important things my mentors have instilled within me was the fact that I can be a pioneer wherever I go. My first realization of this was freshman year high school. I had been creating kinetic novels during my summer vacation and realized that this was the perfect tool to teach with. My history teacher loved my idea to combine computers, teaching, and art, and he provided me an opportunity to share it. Thus, my first computer application was created. I brought my peers an interactive game that taught them about different historical cultures around the world.

<br>
<br>
With all the support and opportunities I've received from those around me, I can only pay it forward with this blog. Like all of the women programmers and scientists I look up to, I hope to inspire all those around me to push beyond the horizon.

Sincerely,
Diane
